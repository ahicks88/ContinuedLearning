## What we'll cover in this course:
1. Exploring raw data
2. Tidying data
3. Preparing data for analysis
4. Putting it all together

---   

```
# View the first 6 rows of data
head(weather)

# View the last 6 rows of data
tail(weather)

# View a condensed summary of the data
str(weather)
```
---

## Exploring RAW data:
1. Understanding the structure of your data
 - class() - Class of data object
 - dim() - Dimension of data
 - names() - Column names
 - str() - Preview of data with helpful details
 - glimpse() - Better version of str() from dplyr
 - summery() - Summary of data
 ```
1. Understanding the structure of your data

# Load the lunch data
lunch <- read.csv("datasets/lunch_clean.csv")
# View its class
class(lunch)

> "data.frame"

# View its dimensions
dim(lunch)

> 46 7

# Look at the column names
names(lunch)

> "year" "avg_free" ... "perc_free_red"

str(lunch) # provides dataframe row & columns, column's names, datatype and heading records

# Load dplyr
library(dplyr)

# View structure of lunch, the dplyr way
glimpse(lunch)

# View a summary
summary(lunch)
```
