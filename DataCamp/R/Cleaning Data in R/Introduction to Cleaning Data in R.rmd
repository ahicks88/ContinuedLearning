## What we'll cover in this course:
1. Exploring raw data
2. Tidying data
3. Preparing data for analysis
4. Putting it all together

---   

```
# View the first 6 rows of data
head(weather)

# View the last 6 rows of data
tail(weather)

# View a condensed summary of the data
str(weather)
```

---

## Exploring RAW data:
1. **Understanding the structure of your data**

    ```
    # Load the lunch data

    lunch <- read.csv("datasets/lunch_clean.csv")
    ```

- **class() - Class of data object**

    ```
    # View its class

    class(lunch)

    > "data.frame"
    ```

- **dim() - Dimension of data**

    ```
    # View its dimensions

    dim(lunch)

    > 46 7
    ```

- **names() - Column names**

    ```
    # Look at the column names

    names(lunch)

    > "year" "avg_free" ... "perc_free_red"
    ```

- **str() - Preview of data with helpful details**

    ```
    str(lunch) # provides dataframe row & columns, column's names, datatype and heading records

    # Load dplyr

    library(dplyr)
    ```

- **glimpse() - Better version of str() from dplyr**

    ```
    # View structure of lunch, the dplyr way

    glimpse(lunch)
    ```

- **summery() - Summary of data**
    
    ```  
    # View a summary      

    summary(lunch)
    ```
